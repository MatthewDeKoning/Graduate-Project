Introduction MOSTLY DONE

*Project Overview and purpose
*goals

*basic equations and concepts
*overview of methods used

Simulation DONE
* methods used
* simulating perfect time
* simulating perfect detection
* noise additions
* results
* use in crafting test vectors

Test Setup MOSTLY DONE
* sensor tradeoff write up
* raspberry pi used for simplicity
* the cases NEED TO DO
* FLIR v3 firmware

Algorithms Used
* detection
* estimation

Test Writeups and Results
* First test writeup DONE
* calibration tests
* second test writeup - to be made
* challenges

Post Processing
* changes to the algorithm
* attempts to tune data to produce correct outputs


Regrets/Future Work (CURRENTLY SPRINKLED THROUGHOUT)
*higher framerate/sampling rate 
*sync sampling
*scaled down test with PIR sensors? 
*more accurate gathered data could probably be manipulated correctly.
